# Skill Distillery

Distill raw material into potent skills. Articles, talks, frameworks, recent AI work, or just an idea — skill-distillery extracts the strategy bottom-up and builds interactive, well-architected skills from it.

**The core insight:** Good skills aren't restructured content — they're distilled strategy. A 5,000-word article becomes a 300-line skill by extracting principles, mental models, and decision frameworks, not by reformatting paragraphs.

## Quick Start

**From an article or framework:**
> `/skill-distillery https://example.com/great-article-about-design-systems`
> `/skill-distillery ~/Documents/talk-transcript.md`

**From recent AI work:**
> `/skill-distillery capture` — "I just figured out a great process for X, help me turn it into a skill"

**From a description:**
> `/skill-distillery` — "I want a skill that helps me write better API documentation"

**Audit an existing skill:**
> `/skill-distillery audit ~/.claude/skills/my-skill`
> `/skill-distillery review` — "Can you evaluate the language-market-fit skill?"

**Add to an existing skill:**
> `/skill-distillery add reference` — "I want to add a new reference file to my-skill"

## Core Principles

These apply to everything skill-distillery does:

1. **Bottom-up synthesis over content restructuring** — Extract principles and mental models from source material. Don't reformat — distill.

2. **Interactive by default** — Use AskUserQuestion for tappable decisions. Ask 2-3 questions at a time, not a wall. Provide shortcuts when context is already available.

3. **Propose before building** — Always present synthesis, architecture, and approach for user approval before creating files. Wait gates at every decision point.

4. **Progressive disclosure** — SKILL.md stays lean (200-300 lines). Reference files contain depth. Load conditionally based on what the user needs.

5. **Opinionated defaults** — Suggest interactive patterns from proven skills (design-portfolio-assistant's discovery phase, language-market-fit's mode detection). The user can override, but the defaults should be good.

6. **Research on demand, not by default** — Most skill creation doesn't need research. Trigger it only when external APIs/libraries are involved or the user explicitly asks. See Research Protocol below.

7. **Tailored to the user's specific goal** — Not generic skill-making advice. Every decision adapts to what this particular user is building for this particular purpose.

8. **Gotchas are the highest-signal content** — The most valuable part of any skill is where Claude typically fails. Every skill should have a dedicated gotchas section documenting specific failure points with "don't do X because Y" structure. Gotchas come from anticipating Claude's failure modes, not theoretical anti-patterns.

9. **Publication-ready by default** — Every skill gets a README.md assuming it may be published on GitHub. After building, offer to publish via `npx skills add` (the skills.sh ecosystem). Ask about target agents early — Claude Code only vs. universal — since it shapes how features like AskUserQuestion are implemented.

## Research Protocol

When and how to research during skill creation.

**When to trigger:**
- Skill involves external APIs or libraries needing current docs
- Domain where best practices shift fast (frameworks, deployment patterns)
- Audit reveals the skill references outdated libraries or patterns
- User explicitly asks: "Can you research X?"

**When NOT to trigger:**
- Source material is self-contained (articles, talks)
- User already knows the domain
- Skill is about internal processes or conventions
- Simple skills that don't reference external tools

**How to ask:** One gate before spawning anything:

> This involves [X]. Want me to research current best practices, or do you have enough context?

If AskUserQuestion is available:
- **Yes, research first** — Fetch current documentation for accurate implementation
- **No, I have context** — Proceed with what we have

**How to execute:** Spawn 2-3 parallel Sonnet agents (fast, cheap, good at retrieval) with specific, scoped questions. Not "research everything about X" — scope to what you actually need.

Example agent prompts:
- "Fetch current Supabase RLS patterns from official docs"
- "Find 2026 best practices for React Native navigation libraries"
- "Check if [library] is still actively maintained"

Use Context7 MCP when available: `resolve-library-id` → `query-docs` for library documentation.

**How to use results:** Feed research back into synthesis and strategy — inform the principles and architecture. Don't dump raw findings into reference files. Present key findings to user before proceeding.

## Entry Point Detection

Detect what the user provided and route to the right workflow:

| User Input | Route To |
|-----------|----------|
| URL (http/https) | `workflows/from-source-material.md` |
| File path to article/doc/transcript | `workflows/from-source-material.md` |
| File path to SKILL.md or skill directory | `workflows/audit-existing-skill.md` |
| "audit", "review", "evaluate" in args | `workflows/audit-existing-skill.md` |
| "capture", "just did", "turn this process" | `workflows/from-recent-work.md` |
| "add reference", "add workflow", "add script" | `workflows/add-component.md` |
| Description of what they want | `workflows/from-description.md` |
| No arguments / unclear | Ask what they'd like to do |

### Detection Logic

1. Check `$ARGUMENTS` for URLs → from-source-material
2. Check `$ARGUMENTS` for file paths → read the file, determine if it's a skill (has YAML frontmatter with `name`/`description`) or source material
3. Check `$ARGUMENTS` for keywords: "audit", "review", "evaluate", "improve" → audit-existing-skill
4. Check `$ARGUMENTS` for keywords: "add reference", "add workflow", "add component" → add-component
5. Check `$ARGUMENTS` for keywords: "capture", "just did", "turn this into" → from-recent-work
6. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a description → from-description
7. If no arguments, ask:

If AskUserQuestion is available:
- **Turn source material into a skill** — I have an article, talk, or framework
- **Capture recent work** — I just did something and want to save the process
- **Describe what I want** — I'll explain what the skill should do
- **Audit an existing skill** — Evaluate a skill I have or found

Otherwise ask: "What would you like to do? (1) Turn source material into a skill, (2) Capture a recent process, (3) Describe what I want, (4) Audit an existing skill"

**After selecting a workflow, read it and follow it exactly.**
